NEOTIMER LIBRARY MODIFICATION

Move definitions to cpp file

~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/Neotimer Â» ls                                                                                                                      
README.md          examples           keywords.txt       library.properties license.txt        neotimer.cpp       neotimer.h


Without this, trying to use the library from another library will raise multiple definition errors for every class method.
